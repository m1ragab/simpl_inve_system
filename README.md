### Inventory Management System
This project will develop a system to track the quantity and location of all inventory items, as well as the movement of goods between different locations.
This will improve the accuracy of inventory records, reduce inventory costs, and improve the efficiency of inventory management. Additionally, the system 
will allow users to craft new items from existing items. This will give users more flexibility in how they use their inventory and will allow them to create
custom items that meet their specific needs.

## Technologies
